A bootstrapped template based on GatsbyJS to generate doc site based on md/mdx content (found in `/docs-src` folder) - WIP

### To run:
1. clone the repo

2. install:

*from repo root:*
```bash
npm install
```

3. run Gatsby dev server:

```bash
npm run develop
```

4. Open in browser `localhost:8000`

5. To see the list of all available pages, type a non-existent address like `localhost:8000/abc` - the error page shows a list of available pages. The main pages we are dealing with are those in `/docs` route.
